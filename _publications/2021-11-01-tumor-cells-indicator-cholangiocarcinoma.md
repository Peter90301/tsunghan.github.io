## Abstract

Exfoliated tumor cells present in bile samples provide a non-invasive approach for monitoring cholangiocarcinoma disease progression and treatment response. This study demonstrates the diagnostic and prognostic potential of analyzing exfoliated cells from bile specimens using microfluidic-based detection methods.

## Key Findings

- Identification of exfoliated tumor cells in bile as reliable disease indicators
- Correlation between cell characteristics and disease severity
- Development of microfluidic-based cell isolation and analysis methods
- Clinical implications for disease monitoring and treatment assessment
