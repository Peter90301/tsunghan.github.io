- Design of microfluidic device architecture for biomarker capture and detection
- Integration of multiple affinity probes for enhanced specificity
- Validation using clinical bile samples from CCA patients
- Development of automated detection and analysis protocols

## Key Achievements

- Successfully demonstrated clinical applicability of the microfluidic platform
- Achieved high sensitivity and specificity for CCA biomarker detection
- Published findings in peer-reviewed journals
- Contributed to advancement of lab-on-a-chip technology for medical diagnostics
