## Abstract

We present an integrated microfluidic platform for rapid and accurate cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) diagnosis from clinical bile juice samples. The platform utilizes multiple affinity reagents to capture and detect disease-specific biomarkers, demonstrating superior diagnostic performance compared to conventional methods.
