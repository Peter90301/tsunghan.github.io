## Abstract

This paper presents an integrated microfluidic system designed for the rapid diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) from bile samples using specific affinity probes. The device enables label-free and real-time detection of biomarkers associated with CCA, offering a promising tool for early disease detection and clinical management.

## Key Contributions

- Development of a miniaturized microfluidic platform for biomarker detection
- Integration of affinity-based capture and detection mechanisms
- Demonstration of clinical applicability using patient bile samples
- Enhanced sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional diagnostic methods
