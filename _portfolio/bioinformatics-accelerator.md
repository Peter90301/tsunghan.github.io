## General-Purpose Accelerator for Bioinformatics

### Overview
This project focuses on designing and developing an efficient in-memory computing accelerator specifically tailored for bioinformatics workloads. By leveraging 3D DRAM technology and processing-in-memory principles, this accelerator aims to dramatically improve performance and energy efficiency for genomic and proteomic analysis tasks.

### Key Objectives
- Design a hardware accelerator that exploits the unique computational patterns of bioinformatics applications
- Leverage 3D DRAM's high bandwidth and memory density for near-data processing
- Minimize data movement between memory and processing units
- Support diverse multi-omics workloads (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics)

### Collaborations
- **Prof. Tajana S. Rosing** (UCSD) - Principal Advisor
- **Prof. Rob Knight's group** (UCSD) - Bioinformatics expertise and real-world workload characterization
- **Niema Moshiri** - Computational biology collaboration for phylogenetics and sequence analysis

### Technologies & Tools
- 3D DRAM architecture and memory technology exploration
- FPGA prototyping and validation
- Hardware-software co-design methodology
- Python-based simulation and analysis

### Impact
This work aims to bridge the gap between computational biology demands and hardware capabilities, enabling faster and more energy-efficient analysis of large-scale genomic and proteomic datasets.
